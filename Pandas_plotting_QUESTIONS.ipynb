        "Pandas is defined as an open-source library that provides high-performance data manipulation in Python. It is built on top of the NumPy package, which means Numpy is required for operating the Pandas. Pandas is a popular library for working with tabular data, as it provides some sets of powerful tools like DataFrame and Series that mainly used for analyzing the data. Besides, Pandas also has higher performance when dealing with very large dataset. In this exercise, we will see how can we use Pandas to read csv file and do some basic calculation.\n",
